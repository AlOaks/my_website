                "Always strive for better/more". Every time I finish a task, I'm always thinking how can I 
                make it better in one or more aspects; functionality, style, efficiency, etc. 
                I tend to avoid the "easy fixes" because "Easy comes, easy goes", right? 
                Always aim to build a solid and clean code. My three greatest passions are Learning, Coding and video games.
                </p>
                <p>My ambition for knowledge is what has filled up my mind with random facts. Always trying to learn new things, 
                practicing old ones. Basically, I can sum up this part of me with one sentence.  
                <span> I'm always trying to be better than me.</span></p>
                <p>But I wasn't always a web developer. I have a background in Music Production and Audio Engineering. 
                I've been playing guitar since I was 15 years old. Equal fan of metal and acoustic music. Sometimes, I just grab 
                my guitar to relax and clean my head out of the logic programming involves.        
                </p>
                <p>Video games, kind of a clich√©, right? Gaming my teens away, and now a programmer. Videogames are a big part 
                of me, I've played hundres of games, thousands of hours and still I enjoying opening for the first time 
                that new title, that new DLC. Some people get lost in a book, in a movie. Well, I get lost in a videogame.</p>
                <p>Hey, if you'd like to keep talking about videogames or coding, or just want to have a chat, don't hesitate 
                and reach out to me. =) </p>
